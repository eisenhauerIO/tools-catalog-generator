# Online Retail Simulator

*Generate synthetic retail data for testing, experimentation, and causal inference*

Organizations need realistic e-commerce data to build analytics, train models, and validate A/B testing pipelines—but using production data creates privacy risks, compliance burdens, and dependency bottlenecks. This package solves that by generating synthetic retail datasets that preserve statistical properties while remaining entirely fictional.

The simulator goes beyond random data generation: it models realistic customer behavior, daily sales patterns, and conversion funnels. For teams running catalog enrichment experiments, it can simulate treatment effects to forecast lift before committing resources to production tests.
